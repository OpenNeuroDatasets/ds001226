Compared to the initial database, 6 patients were excluded: 2 because of glioma grade 4, 3 because of subtentorial tumor, 1 because of absence of MRI data (subdural grid).

Of all subjects the following data were acquired:
- T1w MPRAGE anatomical scan (anat)
- resting-state fMRI (func)
- multi-shell HARDI diffusion-weighted MRI (dwi, acq=AP)
- short DWI with reverse phase encoding directions (dwi, acq=PA)
- cognitive assessment using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB): MOT, RVP, RTI, SSP & SOC
- questionnaires assessing demographic information, lifestyle habits & emotional functioning

The "derivatives" folder contains

- tumor masks, obtained with a combination of manual delineation and disconnectome
- time series, structural and functional connectivity matrices, and resting state HRF for each ROI.
The structural connectivity (SC) is derived with the TVB pipeline (https://github.com/BrainModes/TVB-empirical-data-pipeline) with manual segmentation when necessary.
The regions are according to the Desikan-Killiany atlas.
The resting state HRF is obtained with the toolbox described here Wu GR, Colenbier N, Van Den Bossche S, Clauw K, Johri A, Tandon M, Marinazzo D. rsHRF: A toolbox for resting-state HRF estimation and deconvolution.
