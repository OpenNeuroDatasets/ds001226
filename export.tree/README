Compared to the initial database, 6 patients were excluded: 2 because of glioma grade 4, 3 because of subtentorial tumor, 1 because of absence of MRI data (subdural grid).

Of all subjects the following data were acquired:
- T1w MPRAGE anatomical scan (anat)
- resting-state fMRI (func)
- multi-shell HARDI diffusion-weighted MRI (dwi, acq=AP)
- short DWI with reverse phase encoding directions (dwi, acq=PA)
- cognitive assessment using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB): MOT, RVP, RTI, SSP & SOC
- questionnaires assessing demographic information, lifestyle habits & emotional functioning
